# Social-Distancing
A social distancing detection tool designed to help monitor and enforce physical distancing protocols. Recently, Andrew Ngâ€™s Landing AI team created a Social Distancing Tool using the concepts of Computer Vision. This project is inspired by their work.

This project is an extension of the work done by Aravind Pai to create a social distancing tool. We've incorporated openCV's perspectiveTransform and warpTransform in our code to calculate the distance bw people in the frame in a more efficient way.

Here's the link to Aravind's article: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/05/social-distancing-detection-tool-deep-learning/
